# Working-with-Titanic-Data

This is my first data science project with Kaggle. In this notebook we analyze the data of passengers on Titanic and try to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on the features of the passenger given. Our initial prediction leads to a categorization score of 0.76555 and the latest score we have is ???.
